# ArcFit 

Multiple arc spline approximation for data points with covariances. 

Approximation is done based on solving Constrained Nonlinear Least Squares via Augmented Lagrangian (which is in fact not very efficient)
Needs more development for general options in MultipleArcFit class, but test works quite well on simple cases.
